Notes:
In this lab, you will be using addEventListener and innerHTML to activate buttons. When the button is clicked, it should move the corresponding horse up one step. When a horse reaches the end of the "road" a message will appear saying that that color has won. The blue horse is already done, use it an example.

In the second half of the lab, you will use ARIA and alt text to make the webpage accessible. Resources have been provided.

Prompt:
It's the national horse race again! Three horses line up to race for the finish line. Which one will win? Click the "Run!" button to activate a horse. (Try the blue one, it works!) When it gets to the end of the screen, a text should appear announcing that horse the winner.

Directions: 
Your task is to finish the website so that the pink and brown horse also work the same as the blue horse. You'll have to use querySelector, addEventListener, and arrow functions to do so. For the extensions, you'll have a chance to add a fourth horse, a reset button, and more.

1)   If you haven't already, check out the website and notice that when you click the "Run!" button next to the blue horse, the blue horse moves forward a bit. First thing we're going to work on is getting the other horses to do the same. This will be done in 3 parts: 1st, you'll need querySelectors to listen to the button and move the horse image, 2nd, you'll need to create addEventListeners for each button, and 3rd, you'll need to create a function that advances the horse once the button is clicked.

2)   First, go to the script.js and notice that there are 2 querySelctors: one for the blueButton, and one for the blueHorse. We need the first to listen to when the "Run!" button is clicked, and we need the second to move the image of the horse. Do the same for the pink horse and the brown horse. If you're stuck look below for the code for the pink horse:

        const pinkButton = document.querySelector("#pink-button");
        const pinkHorse = document.querySelector("#pink-horse");

3)   Second, scroll to the bottom, and notice that there is an addEventListener for the blueButton that calls a function "advanceBlue". Create 2 more addEventListeners, one for the pinkButton and one for the brownButton. When these buttons are clicked, they should call a function called "advancePink" and "advanceBrown" respectively. Use the blue button's event listener for reference.

4)   Third, find the section on the page where the OnClick functions are declared. Notice that the advanceBlue() arrow function is already made, and the advancePink() function is set up, but not completed. Complete the advancePink function so that it increments the pink_position variable by 1, then it should adjust the image of the horse using the function changePosition that takes in 2 variables as parameters: the querySelector for the horse, and the new position. Use the advanceBlue function for reference.

5)   Great! Now head over to the website and check that all 3 of your buttons are working.

6)   Now, when a horse gets to the end of the race, you'll have to announce that that horse is the winner. Edit the checkWinner() function so that it writes a winner to the screen based on the position of the horse:

    - First, up with all the other query selectors, write a new querySelector for the div with an id="winner"

    - Then, in the checkWinner() function, write an if statement: If the horse's position is equal to 5, change the innerHTML of the winner div to, for example, "Blue is the Winner!". Use the position       argument and the color to help.

    - NOTE: use console.log() where needed to check that your code is doing what it should.

7) After the function is set up, you'll need to call it in each of the advanceColor() functions. For example, here's what the advanceBlue() function should look like:

      const advanceBlue = (e) => {
          blue_position += 1;
          changePosition(blueHorse, blue_position);
          checkWinner(blue_position, "Blue");
      };

8)   Make it accessible: When you turn on the screen reader, what do you notice that could be improved?

      - Notice that neither the buttons nor the horses have a descriptive enough alt text. The screen reader just announces "Run! Button" for the button and "Blue Horse", for example, for the horses.

      - When the buttons are clicked, nothing is said by the screen reader.

      - Lastly, when a horse reaches the end, there is no way for someone who is blind to know that the race is over.

9)   For the buttons, use the aria-label property to give it a good descriptive text that will be read when hovered over by a screen reader. In the index.html add aria-label="Advance blue horse" in the blue button element. Do the same for the other 2 buttons. Here's a resource on aria-label.

10)   The image of the horse already has alt text, but change it so that it includes the position of the horse in the track. The horses all start at position 1 out of 5: alt="blue horse at position 1 out of 5". Do the same for the other 2 horse images in the index.html.

11)  In the script.js, when a button is clicked, also change the alt text so that it contains the new position. At the end of the advanceBlue function, use .alt to set alt text. Here's a resource with examples. Again, make sure you do this for all three horses.

12)   Now that the text is available, descriptive, and updating with every button click, the last step will be to make sure that the screen reader announces those updates. Add the following 2 attributes to each of the image elements: aria-live="polite" and aria-atomic="true". In the div where the winner text is displayed, use these two as well but make the aria-live="assertive". For example:

        <div id="winner" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div>
        Check out this resource on aria-live and this one on aria-atomic.

Extensions

Mild

- Once the game is over, notice that the other buttons still work. In fact, if the blue horse wins, you can get another horse to the finish line overwriting who the winner is. Use blueButton.disabled = true; to disable all three of the buttons once a winner is declared. You'll want to put the statements in the if statement of your checkWinner function. Use the documentation for disabling buttons for more information.

- Using everything you've learned up until now, add a restart button to the page that starts the game over. Use a basic <button> element tag and give it the label "Restart Game". Disable it while the game is in progress, and reenable it once the game is over and there's a winner. The restart button should do 3 things:

      - set the horses position to 1, back to the starting position,

      - reenable the buttons,

      - clear the innerHTML of the div with id="winner", and

Medium

- Change the restart button so that it appears and disappears instead of being enabled and disabled. Be sure your button has an ID so you can use querySelector to access it. Then, change the display to "none" to hide it or "block" to show it. Use this resource for some help.

        myButton.style.display = "none";

- Add another button between the title and the horses named "Steps". Then, immediately after, add a div id="steps" that will hold the output of that button. The "Steps" button when clicked should output a random number either 0, 1, or 2 in the innerHTML of the div. Use the following code to generate the random number. Here is a resource if you'd like to learn more.

        let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);

Once the button generates random numbers, use it to tell you how far to move each horse. For example, starting with the blue horse, let's say you click the "Steps" button, and it outputs 1. That means we will click the "Run!" button for the blue horse 1 time. Then, click the "Steps" button again for the pink horse; let's say it says 0. Then, we skip over the pink horse's "Run! button", and so on until a horse wins.

Spicy

- Create a duplicate of the "Steps" button as done above, but call it "Color". In the index.html, there should now be 2 buttons and 2 divs for the button's outputs. The first should be div id="steps" and this second should be div id="chosen-horse". In the script.js, create another event listener function so that when the "Color" button is clicked, it changes the innerHTML of the new div id="chosen-horse" to...

      "Blue" if the random number is 0,
      
      "Pink" if it is 1, and
      
      "Brown" if it is 2.

Now, before advancing any horse, click both the "Steps" button and the "Color" button. If the outputs are "2" and "Brown", for example, then advance the brown horse 2 steps, and so on until a horse wins.

- There's currently quite a bit of redundancy in the code; there's repetition where there doesn't need to be. For this extension, you'll change the advanceBlue(), advancePink(), and advanceBrown() functions into 1 function called advance():

    First, head to the top of code and change all the variables so that they are in 1 object. You will have to eventually delete blue_position, pink_position, brown_position, and all the query
    selectors. The new object should be called horses and have 3 keys: "blue", "pink", and "brown". Each of the values should be another object with 3 keys as follows:

          let horses = {
              "blue" : {
                  "position" : 1,
                  "button" : document.querySelector("#blue-button"),
                  "horse" : document.querySelector("#blue-horse")
              },
              "pink" : //etc...
          };
  
    When you've done this for all 3 colors, test that it is working by printing the pink position with console.log(horses["pink"].position).

- Next, in the advance() functions, they should each have a parameter e which points to all the attributes associated with the button that calls it. Print e.target and notice that the entire element is printed. Then, print e.target.value to the console in one of the functions to see what value is given. The blue button should print "blue", the pink button "pink", and so on. You'll use these values to help access the right information from the object you created.

        const advanceBlue = (e) => {
            console.log(e.target)
            console.log(e.target.value);
            //...
        }

- Now, create a new advance() function that will replace the 3 current advance functions. This new function should do the same as the others, but instead of writing and reading from a specific variable, write and read to and from the object based on the e.target.value. Here's the partial code:

        const advance = (e) => {
            color = e.target.value;
            horses[color].position += 1
            // etc...
        }

- Finally, change the addEventListeners at the bottom of the code to run the advance() function, and test that everything still works.

      horses["blue"].button.addEventListener("click", advance);
      //etc...

- NOTE: if you implemented a restart button, and included disables everywhere, you'll need to change those as well

      horses["blue"].button.disabled = false;
      //etc...
